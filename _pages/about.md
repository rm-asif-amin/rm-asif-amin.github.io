I specialize in building ML systems, with a foundation in academic research as a [student researcher](/publications/). I transitioned to the industry after graduating, where I had the opportunity to apply ML at a national scale, for a substantial user base of over 50 million people. My most recent project facilitated safe and reliable access to the financial mainstream for the youth in my nation.

Driven by the goal of bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications, my unique offering is a blend of technical prowess and creative passion. I've found myself often connecting seemingly disparate dots to find elegant, minimal solutions to problems. I combine that passion with compassion towards my peers and believe that my strongest contributions to a group is of the human kind rather than technical.

Beyond technology, I express myself through music as a [guitarist and songwriter](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3w1P2KGncFzCAVqT3hdmt4), drawing inspiration from the intricate worlds of Science-Fiction and Techno-Thrillers.
