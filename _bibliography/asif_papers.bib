abstract={The paper investigates the usability of fuzzy inference systems, namely ANFIS to assist in the detection of exoplanet transit events from time-series data of Flux intensity values from host stars. We use statistical properties of time curves, principal component analysis, and dynamic time warping (DTW) to extract features from time-series data. We propose the use of aggregated DTW distance to all positive training samples as a feature and show that it significantly increases performance if used along with statistical features and principal components. We propose that fuzzy methods can be used to classify exoplanet systems with a relatively low false positive rate and thus, can be used to filter out possible flux signatures for review by human experts.},

  abstract={This study focuses on the temporally evolving geo-environmental characteristics of Dhaka. Dhaka is located at the center of Bangladesh. In the last few decades, it has undergone rapid development in terms of infrastructure and economy. The land use pattern in Dhaka is not the same as it had been previously. The focus has been to analyze the changes that have occurred in Dhaka, which consists of six smaller cities inside it. Using remote sensing techniques and various satellite images, the objects are classified into different categories. Multi spectral characteristics and spectral response patterns are analyzed and studied. Using the information extracted across different decades, changes in land use have been derived. Furthermore, changes in different features e.g. built up, crops, water bodies etc. are analyzed and studied across years to factor out the zones that are experiencing recent urban growth. This generalized pattern of urban growth can be a valuable finding for urban planning and policy for the government of Bangladesh.},
